## 🏗️ Core Systems & Features

### ⚔️ Combat System (Component-Based)
- Fully modular combat architecture implemented via Blueprint components
- Supports multiple combat styles:
  - Sword
  - Rifle
  - Punch
  - Shield
- Dodge system integrated with animation montages
- Combat logic is **decoupled from the Character Blueprint**, allowing reuse and scalability

---

### 👤 Player State System
- Player stats and states implemented as **independent Blueprint components**
- Clean separation between:
  - Character visuals & movement
  - Gameplay logic & player data
- Designed for easy extension (abilities, buffs, debuffs, etc.)

---

### 🧍 Character Movement & Animation
- **Motion Matching** implemented for realistic and responsive locomotion
- Animation-driven movement for improved visual fidelity
- Combat montages integrated seamlessly with motion matching setup

---

### 🤖 Enemy AI (Prototype)
- Basic enemy AI created to:
  - Test combat flow
  - Validate animation montages
  - Evaluate player feedback during combat
- Focused on functionality rather than final behavior complexity

---

### ⚙️ Settings Menu
- In-game settings menu implemented using Blueprints
- Supports:
  - Graphics options
  - Performance-related settings
- Designed to integrate with RTX features

---

## 🎨 Rendering & Performance
Built using the **NVIDIA RTX branch of Unreal Engine 5.7**, integrating:

- NVIDIA DLSS
- DLSS Ray Reconstruction
- DLSS Frame Generation
- NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) Sharpening

These features were used to study:
- Performance vs visual quality trade-offs
- Real-time rendering optimization workflows

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints)**
- NVIDIA RTX UE Branch
- Perforce (Version Control)
- Blender (Assets / Prototyping)
- Motion Matching (UE5 Animation System)

---

## 📌 Development Focus
This project emphasizes:
- Clean Blueprint architecture
- Modular and reusable systems
- Industry-style workflows
- Visual quality and performance awareness

It is **not a tutorial project** and was developed iteratively with testing and refactoring.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Advanced enemy behavior using Behavior Trees
- Expanded player abilities and skill systems
- Deeper AI combat interactions
- Further performance benchmarking across hardware
